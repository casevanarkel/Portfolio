        I am a creative UX engineer that puts the user at the center of everything I build. In addition to engineering, I'm a naturally holistic thinker drawn to the spectrum of business challenges that require both left and right brain thinking. Prior to teaching myself how to write code, I was trained as both an artist and a marketer.
        <br><br>
        My professional mission is to create beautiful experiences that both educate and ignite joy.
        <br><br>
        Outside of my profession, I'm passionate about running, exploring the outdoors with my partner (see pretty lady above), reading philosophy, painting, playing guitar, and generally tinkering.
        <br><br>I am also working on a side project: a health app that displays various health metrics including exercise, phone screen time, and work time.
        <br><br>Let's grab tea, I'd love the opportunity to get to know you better.
