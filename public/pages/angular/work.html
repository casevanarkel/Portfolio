			How can children learn about growth mindset strategies in a fun, interactive way? AdaptedMind Super Skills has the answer. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I worked with an incredibly team of people to help create the front end UX for AdaptedMind Super Skills. Due to an unexpectedly tight deadline, I had less than 4 hours to write and test the front end code of the UX consisting of CSS, HTML and Javascript within an AngularJS framework. Throughout the duration of the project I also acted as the front end product manager, collaborating with a UI designer, voice actor, animator, producer, and back end engineer to make sure the UX was exactly what we wanted.

			Do you recall how entertaining and educational the Magic School Bus television show made learning science? Imagine placeing those episodes within a social studies context and throw in an interactive UX with game mechanicsâ€”this is AdaptedMind Social Studies. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I worked over several months with an immensely talented team to help create AdaptedMind Social Studies. I wrote a significant amount of the code for the front end using HTML, CSS and jQuery, and due to an unexpected shortage in back end engineering resources I also wrote a sizable portion of the back end using Javascript within an AngularJS framework.
			I also acted as the front end product manager, collaborating with UI designers, voice actors, animators, a producer, a back end engineer, and the CEO to build the complex product consiting of an interactive map and 12 animated video experiences.
