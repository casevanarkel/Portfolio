			How can children learn about growth mindset strategies in a fun, interactive way? AdaptedMind Super Skills has the answer. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I worked with an incredibly talented team of people to create AdaptedMind Super Skills. Due to an unexpectedly tight deadline, I had less than 4 hours to write and test my front end code consisting of CSS, HTML and Javascript within an AngularJS framework. Throughout the duration of the project I also acted as the front end product manager, collaborating with a UI designer, voice actor, animator, producer, and back end engineer to make sure the UX was exactly what we wanted.

			The educational and entertaining televelsion cartoon Magic School Bus made learning science fun. Imagine placing a cartoon like that within a social studies learning context and throw in an interactive UX with game mechanicsâ€”this is AdaptedMind Social Studies. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I worked with an immensely talented team to build AdaptedMind Social Studies. I wrote a significant amount of the code for the front end using HTML, CSS and jQuery, and due to an unexpected shortage in back end engineering availability I also wrote a sizable portion of the back end behvaior using Javascript within an AngularJS framework.
			I also acted as the front end product manager, collaborating with UI designers, voice actors, animators, a producer, a back end engineer, and the CEO to build the complex product consiting of an interactive map and 12 animated video experiences.

			Think of the millions of useful science related learning videos on Youtube. Now, imagine all these videos vetted by education professionals, and then placed strategically within a gamified UX to maximize both learning and fun--this is AdaptedMind Science.   
			<br>
			<br>
			Science was one of my favorite subjects in grade school. With AdaptedMind Science I had the opportunity to work with a small, elite team to help build the product from inception to completion. I built the entire front end using HTML, CSS and jQuery, all within an AngularJS framework. Science's UX challenges also introduced me to an innovative animation tool <a href="https://airbnb.io/lottie/" target="_blank">Bodymovin/Lottie</a>, which I became a knowledge expert in.
			I also acted as the front end product manager, collaborating with a curriculum expert, UI designer, game artist, voice actor, animator, back end engineer, and the CEO to build the interactive learning experience.

			AdaptedMind's unique math product provides both an innovative adaptive algorithm to enhance learning, as well as a gamified incentive structure in increase motivation.    
			<br>
			<br>
			This UX is an example of an all too familiar business challenge: combining what's true and tested (in other words: what works) with what's experimental and radically new. Since the moment I teammed up with AdaptedMind, we've been optimizing the math product like crazy. I've both product managed and built over 30 experiment variations using CSS, HTML, and AngularJS, with several variations contributing to significant gains in conversion rate metrics. Although the result of rapid experimentation has lead to a hodge-podge of styles for the product, we find it to be beautiful in how it performs for the business.
