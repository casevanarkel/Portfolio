			How can children learn about growth mindset strategies in a fun, interactive way? AdaptedMind Super Skills does it better than anyone I've seen. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I worked with a team of incredibly talented visual and voice artists, animators, producers, and back end engineers to help create the front end UX for AdaptedMind Super Skills. Due to an unexpectedly tight deadline, I had less than 4 hours to write and test the front end code of the UX consisting of CSS, HTML and Javascript within and AngularJS framework. I also product managed collaborating with a UI designer, voice artist, animator, producer, and back end engineer to make sure the UX was exactly what we wanted. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The experience starts with an introduction to the Super Skills world and then prompts the student customizer their own monster avater. Quickly the UX jumps into the first episode, and then ends with a series of quiz questions and a free trial sign up form.
